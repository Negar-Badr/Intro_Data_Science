first issue in my opinion was that the two categories: course and major/academic are very close knit to eachother so i don't thing it was such a good idea to separate them or at least the separation was not quite clear
The other thing is that sometime on the post title it literally says both of the categories like cs major + career, since we are no considering the actual content within the post we can't really say which category it belongs to. to tackle this we can either define a new category where we add all the posts conceringin more than one category or i actually don't know what else to do!!!
Third, in one specific case my answer was different than both my annotaters which shows i was not clear in explaining my catgories clearly!
