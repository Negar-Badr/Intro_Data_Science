Conceptual Exercises
1.	Why is the difference between found and designed data?
Found data is the data the was gathered for other purposes like social media posts or reusing the surveys or goverment reports. the hassle in this one is that we have to clean data and remove the parts we don't need.
Designed data is gathered specifically for our project for example surveying for our specific problem or conducting experiments. The time consuming part is that we have to create data from scratch.


2.	What are the two primary challenges that necessitate sampling when collecting data?
first is when the question is too broad/indefnite we have too many approaches to gather data and not sure if they would cover all that it's almost impossible, like all the bots that post o reddit.
Second it's impossible to access all the data either because you're not allowed or you have to pay for it, like gathering all tweets.

3.	Why are website owners more likely to be upset about collecting data using scrapers than using APIs?
Beacuse it puts unnecessary load on their servers, and also citing a thing or two is different than actually accessing all their data which is loss of their intellectual property.
But with APIs, with measures like authetication or blacklisting they have some control on the data being used from their servers.
