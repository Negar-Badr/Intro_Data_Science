Q1: 
• Cost Efficiency
• Collabration
• Storage Capacity
• Remote Access

Q2:
Question Definition -	clearly define the problem we want to solve using data analytics
Data Collection - 	Gathering relevant data from different resources, including databases, APIs, or web scraping
Data Annotation - 	Cleaning and preparing(labeling,tagging, ...) the raw data and transforming it into a suitable format for analysis.
Data Analysis - 	Applying analytical, or machine learning methods to the annotated data to extract meaningful insights, trends, or patterns.
Interpretation -	Drawing conclusions from the analysis results
communication -		Presenting the results

Q3:
data analysis is a phase in data science process that measures data to find a new insight but data science is focused on contributing new techniques in a more comprehensive approach.

Q4:
If the wrong question is defined at the start, for instance, if during the data analysis or interpretation stage you realize that the insights you're gaining don't address the actual business problem, you might need to loop back to the question definition stage.
